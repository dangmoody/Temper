The Tantrum update

TODO:
1 - Test auto registration and execution (with flags for skipping and declaring which suite they belong to)
2 - Test condition macros
3 - parametric tests
4 - Logging in release code to fail tests if conditions aren't met
5 - AIMING for header only

TO AVOID
1 - Test fixtures with V-tables
2 - Running tests in parallel
3 - Making this framework a C++ only system, must work in C99! (less a thing for Dan and more for me)
