Tantrum (TemperV2)

TODO:
0 - AIMING for the final shipable version of this to be a SINGLE header only. Bear this in mind with each feature we build.
1 - Test auto registration and execution (with flags for skipping and declaring which suite they belong to).
2 - Logging in release code to fail tests if conditions aren't met, as well as provide a basic AddExpectedError(const char*) and AssertErrorOccured(const char*))
3 - Parametric testing support, it's very useful not only when doing low level engine stuff but also occasionally in gameplay testing and other higher level features.
4 - Test condition macros (e.g. TEST_TRUE(condition, message), TEST_GREATER_THAN(conditionA, conditionB, message), TEST_ALMOST_EQUAL(conditionA, conditionB, tolerance, message))
5 - An Extra run command to act as a basic search - running any test with a name containing a given set of characters

TO AVOID
1 - Test fixtures with V-tables
2 - Running tests in parallel
3 - Making this framework a C++ only system, must work in C99! (less a thing for Dan and more for Mike as an advisary)
